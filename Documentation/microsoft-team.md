# Microsoft Team Onboarding

If you are new to Microsoft, you will need to onboard into various GitHub projects in order to get your work done.

## Get Permissions

You first need to link your GitHub account so that you can use Microsoft's GitHub management tools.

* [Link your GitHub account](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/link)

There are two main teams to join to get access to Microsoft .NET-related projects.

* [Add yourself to the microsoft team in the dotnet org](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/dotnet/teams/microsoft/join/)
* [Add yourself to the dotnet team in the microsoft org](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/Microsoft/teams/dotnet/join/)

The primary reason to join the orgs are the following: 

* Users will be able to @mention you on [.NET Core Repos](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/core-repos.md)
* You will be able to access any private repos we maintain
* You will get write access to a subset of repos

## Get Write Access to Repos (Optional)

Join teams to gain write access to repos:
    * Request team membership via https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/teams
    * Find the right teams - e.g. `dotnet-coreclr`, `dotnet-corefx`, etc.
    * Ask someone if you don't know which team to join.
    * Select `Request to join this team` on the right side - it will send email request to maintainers of the team

## Setup Your Account (optional)
* Publicly associate yourself with **Microsoft organization**
    * Go to https://github.com/orgs/Microsoft/people
    * Search for your GH login in the list
    * Choose `Public` from the drop-down list of organization visibility
    * Note: Everyone will now see a Microsoft badge on your GH profile in Organizations section on the left side
* Publicly associate yourself with **dotnet organization**
    * Go to https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/people
    * Search for your GH login in the list
    * Choose `Public` from the drop-down list of organization visibility
    * Note: Everyone will now see a dotnet badge on your GH profile in Organizations section on the left side
* Update your profile
    * Go to https://github.com/settings/profile
    * Match your **Name** on GitHub with full name in address book (so other employees can find you and contact you internally when needed)
    * Set `@Microsoft` as your **Company**
    * Upload your **picture**, ideally showing your face
        * Hint: You can grab your GAL picture from https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com
